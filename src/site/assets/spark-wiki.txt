'''Spark''' is a [[free and open source software]] web application library and [[domain-specific language]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It is an alternative to other Java web application frameworks such as [[JAX-RS]], [[Play framework]] and [[Spring Framework|Spring MVC]]. It is dependent on the [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty]] web server .

Designed and developed by Per Wendel, Spark is small and flexible. Inspired by [[Sinatra (software)]], it does not follow the typical [[model–view–controller]] pattern used in other frameworks, such as Spring MVC. Instead, Spark focuses on "quickly creating web-applications in Java with minimal effort."<ref>[http://sparkjava.com/index.html Spark]</ref>

Spark was created and open-sourced in 2011.

== Example (Hello World) ==
<source lang="java">
import static spark.Spark.*;
import spark.*;

public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      get("/hello", (request, response) -> {
         return "Hello World!";
      });
   
   }
}
