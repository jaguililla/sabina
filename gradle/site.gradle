 * To apply this script, you need to add the JBake plugin manually at the top of your build script
 * as that is not possible in included scripts like this one. These are the required lines to do so:
 *
 * buildscript {
 *     repositories {
 *         jcenter ()
 *     }
 *
 *     dependencies {
 *         classpath 'org.freemarker:freemarker:2.3.19'
 *         classpath 'org.pegdown:pegdown:1.4.2'
 *         classpath 'org.asciidoctor:asciidoctorj:1.5.2'
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * plugins {
 *     id 'me.champeau.jbake' version '0.2'
